                                    If you regularly check your pets for ticks after walks, you may find them before they have had the chance to attach. They are most common on the head, ears, armpits, groin and tummy.

                                    If you use a regular parasite treatment that covers for ticks, any ticks that attaches to your pets should die

                                <li>
                                    However, it’s still sensible to remove any ticks you see to reduce the chance of any diseases being passed to your pet
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        <li>
                            Use repellents

                                <li>
                                    If yo  u live in a high-risk area, or your pet is prone to picking up ticks, you may want to consider using a tick repellents during the summer months, to prevent any from attaching in the first place
